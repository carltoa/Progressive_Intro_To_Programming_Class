# Intro to Programming Day 1

- Precursor to .NET:
    - ASP .NET Web Forms
        - ASP = Active Server Pages
        - simple server-side code for web apps
        - enabled VB use for web
    - XSP (XML Server Pages)
        - XML pages with some HTML code in it
        - written in J++ (Microsoft's version of Java)

- .NET
    - Microsoft made good IDE for this: Visual Studio.net
    - Performance
        - eliminated the need for a runtime interpreter (like the JVM in Java) by making it Windows-only
            - allowed it to talk to the Windows OS directly
        - better performance b/c direct contact with OS
        - did some other stuff in code to make it run better too
    - uses CLM (common language runtime)
        - allows other languages to be created and be compatible with framework (?)
