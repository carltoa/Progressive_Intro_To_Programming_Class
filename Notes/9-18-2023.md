# Intro to Programming Day 1

- Precursor to .NET:
    - ASP .NET Web Forms
        - ASP = Active Server Pages
        - simple server-side code for web apps
        - enabled VB use for web
    - XSP (XML Server Pages)
        - XML pages with some HTML code in it
        - written in J++ (Microsoft's version of Java)

- .NET
    - Microsoft made good IDE for this: Visual Studio.net
    - Performance
        - eliminated the need for a runtime interpreter (like the JVM in Java) by making it Windows-only
            - allowed it to talk to the Windows OS directly
        - better performance b/c direct contact with OS
        - did some other stuff in code to make it run better too
    - uses CLM (common language runtime)
        - allows other languages to be created and be compatible with framework (?)


## VS Keyboard Shortcuts
- Ctrl + .
    - if a line of code has errors (has a red underline), VS provides suggestions for fixing it

- Ctrl + F5
    - Run (without debugger)

- Ctrl + l
    - allows navigating Solution Explorer with keyboard & arrow keys

- Ctrl + tab
    - Quick-naviagte through open files

- Ctrl + [ + s
    - show current file's location in Solution Explorer

- Ctrl + t
    - changes the current tab to whichever file you search for

- Ctrl + g
    - go to specific line number (should open dialog box to enter line number in)

- Ctrl + ]
    - takes you to matching opening/closing symbol
    - ex. if you're on one of the two "{}" symbols, i.e. the bottom one (}), and want to find it's corresponding opening brace ({), put cursor on "}" and hit Ctrl + ]
